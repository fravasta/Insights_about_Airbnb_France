# Insights about Airbnb France 

## Project Description
This project analyzes Airbnb data to provide detailed insights into accommodation trends, pricing strategies, host characteristics, and traveler priorities in France. By leveraging this dashboard, both new and experienced Airbnb hosts can optimize their offerings to align with market demands, while travelers can gain a better understanding of regional trends and prioritize their preferences.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Ensured the dataset was clean and consistent:
     - Removed duplicates and null values.
     - Standardized column names and data types for ease of analysis.
     - Created new variables like **host categories** (based on experience) and **accommodation categories**.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created additional variables, including:
     - **Average price per traveler** to compare pricing fairness.
     - **Family-friendly categories** based on the number of travelers an accommodation can host.

4. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Extracted and analyzed traveler reviews to identify key priorities such as comfort, cleanliness, and scenic views.
